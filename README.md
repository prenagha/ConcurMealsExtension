ConcurMeals Safari Extension
=======================

Safari Extension to provide assistance in managing to a daily maximum meal allowance when
entering expenses using Concur

The extension adds a "Meals" item to the top of the screen, near the Welcome text. Click
"Meals" and the extension will find all expenses of "Meals" type, add them up grouped by
date, compare the daily total to the maximum you defined in the extension settings, and
